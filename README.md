Data and information for the session on Bayesian hierarchical modelling of SARS-CoV-2 viral load data.
Taught at the Cambridge Infectious Diseases and Cambridge Centre for Data-Driven Discovery skills development workshop on 'Bayesian inference methods for infectious diseases research' (27th March 2023).

Data has three columns: `i` is a unique id per individual, `t` is the days since the viral load peak, and `obs_ct` is the measured Ct value.
Code to simulate the data is in the `R` folder, and the simulated data to use in the practical is in `data`.
